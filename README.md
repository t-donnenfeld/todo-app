This is a skeleton of Spring Boot application which should be used as a start point to create a working one.
The goal of this task is to create simple REST API  which allows users to manage TODOs. 
The API should allow to create/delete/update TODOs and categories as well as search for user, name, description, deadline and category in any combination. *For example find all todos for an user X where deadline is today and name contains test.* 
The API should also implement basic authorization/authentication: *User X cannot access TODOs of user Y as long as he doesn't have admin role.*

You are free to use any library or testing framework in the project.
